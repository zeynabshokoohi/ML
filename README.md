# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of various machine learning concepts and their practical applications.
We will explore the machine learning pipeline and gain insights into supervised learning, regression models, and classification algorithms,unsupervised learning, clustering techniques, and ensemble modeling and also evaluate popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.
